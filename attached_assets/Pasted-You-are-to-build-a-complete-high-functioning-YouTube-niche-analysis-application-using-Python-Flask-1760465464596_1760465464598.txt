You are to build a complete, high-functioning YouTube niche-analysis application using Python (Flask + Pandas + YouTube Data API v3).

### Goal:
Create a web-based dashboard where I can input or upload a list of YouTube video URLs (initially use the 13 links below), and the app will:
1. Fetch detailed stats for each video (title, channel, views, likes, comments, upload date, duration, etc.).
2. Calculate engagement and competition metrics to identify low-competition but high-engagement niches.
3. Fetch top-performing related videos and competitor channels for each niche.
4. Display everything in a clean, sortable table (DataTable style) and exportable as CSV.

### Input Data (seed video URLs):
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41i2XIV8mCI
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFUajdEGf7c
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtDKKJq9u30

### Features and Requirements

**Backend (Python / Flask):**
- Use the YouTube Data API v3 (user provides API key via `.env`).
- Endpoints:
  - `/analyze` – fetches and processes the above videos and returns JSON data.
  - `/related/<video_id>` – fetches top 5–10 related videos for a given seed video.
- Functions:
  - `get_video_details(video_ids)` → returns title, views, likes, comments, duration, upload_date, channel_id, channel_title.
  - `get_channel_stats(channel_ids)` → returns subscriber counts.
  - `calculate_metrics()` → computes:
      - Duration in minutes
      - Days since upload
      - View velocity (views / days)
      - Engagement % = (likes + comments) / views * 100
      - Competition score = weighted average of (avg top-channel subs + recent upload frequency + number of related results)
  - Cluster or group videos into niches based on main keywords from titles/tags (e.g. using TF-IDF or simple keyword frequency).

**Frontend (Flask + HTML + JS):**
- Simple clean dashboard (Bootstrap or Tailwind).
- Upload or paste URLs in a text box.
- “Run Analysis” button triggers backend API.
- Displays results in an interactive DataTable with columns:

| Video Title | Channel | Channel Subs | Views | Likes | Comments | Duration (min) | Upload Date | Days Since Upload | View Velocity | Engagement % | Competition Score | Main Keyword | Best Related Videos | Niche |

- Include sorting, search, and CSV export.

**Metrics / Logic:**
- Filter videos to only 10–30 minutes duration.
- Highlight high-engagement videos (Engagement% > 3%) in green.
- Highlight low-competition niches (Competition < 40) in blue.
- Show top 3 related competitor videos per seed.

**Extra Functionality:**
- Cache API responses locally (e.g., in `data/cache.json`) to save quota.
- Export results as `results.csv`.

### Implementation Notes:
- Use `google-api-python-client`, `pandas`, `flask`, `requests`, and optionally `jinja2` templates.
- Store the provided 13 URLs in a `seeds.txt` file.
- Read API key from `.env` using `python-dotenv`.
- Output all computed data in a single DataFrame and serve to frontend as JSON.
- Keep the code clean, modular, and commented.

---

### Deliverables:
1. Complete Flask project structure:
   - `app.py`
   - `templates/index.html`
   - `static/style.css` (basic)
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `.env.example`
   - `seeds.txt`
2. Working demo endpoint `/analyze` that runs the analysis on the given 13 URLs.
3. HTML dashboard showing results in an interactive sortable table.
4. Optional: download CSV button for exporting results.

### Tech Summary:
- Language: Python 3
- Framework: Flask
- Libraries: google-api-python-client, pandas, python-dateutil, requests, flask, python-dotenv
- Frontend: HTML + Tailwind or Bootstrap + JS DataTables
